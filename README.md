## About Me

Even though I have been messing with coding in general since I was 15, my first actual experiences with programming were between 2011 - 2017, while I was graduating in Chemical Engineering. Most of these experiences were related to engineering tools like [Aspen Plus], [COMSOL], [Matlab], Fortran, VBA and C++. 

In 2018, I started working with Operations Research, focusing on mathematical models designed for the optimization of integrated logistic systems. Most of my work in this area is related to algorithm development using CLI C/C++ apps. During this period, I also worked as a full-stack developer in a [Outsystems] based project. More recently, I started working as a software developer, where I deal on a daily basis with C# development (.NET Framework, .NET Core), C/C++ (Win32), CMake, SQL, network management, and so many other recurring tools in the world of development. 

I also have a pet project called [FlashMEMO], which is a learning platform based on Flashcards and the [Spaced Repetition] memorization method. **I'm currently developping a new version of the FlashMEMO website, which uses tools such as .NET Core, Angular, Kubernetes, AWS, and more. For security reasons I set those as private repositories, but I can share them with you if request it.**

All these personal projects have the goal of extending my knowledge of programming tools, and also to learn and apply the most recent architecture and coding guidelines.
