# About Me

Although I've been tinkering with coding since the age of 15, my formal experiences with programming occurred between 2011 and 2017 while I was pursuing my degree in Chemical Engineering. During this time, I worked extensively with engineering tools such as [Aspen Plus], [COMSOL], Matlab, Fortran, VBA, and C++.

In 2018, I transitioned to Operations Research, specializing in the development of mathematical models for optimizing integrated logistic systems. My focus then was algorithm development using CLI C/C++ applications. Simultaneously, I worked as a full-stack developer on an [Outsystems]-based project during that period. Since then, I've been professionally involved in the development of web and desktop applications, with a current emphasis on C# (.NET Framework, .NET Core) and C++ development.

One of my pet projects is FlashMEMO, a learning platform based on Flashcards and [Spaced Repetition]. Although I initially hosted a version of the website on the Outsystems cloud environment, recent updates disrupted key functionalities. Consequently, I've been developing a new version, primarily based on Angular and .NET. You can access it here (coming soonâ„¢). *While I maintain the source code privately for security reasons, I am happy to share it with you if you are interested in this pet project*.

On this GitHub page you'll find various small projects developed throughout my academic career or in recent days. These projects span from algorithm implementations to simple proof-of-concept applications, serving the purpose of validating coding paradigms that interest me. All personal projects showcased here aim to expand my knowledge of programming tools and to explore and apply the latest architectural and coding guidelines.
